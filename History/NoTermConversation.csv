Generic/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_002_2136504208	<yes><NPCName> got in contact with me and told me to come check out <IslandName>.þ
Generic/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_003_1136621488	<thinking>When she told me about all the tucker you can find here, I had to pack my bags and come take a look.þ
Generic/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_004_1234442374	<glee>I bloody love cooking and eating great food.þ
Generic/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_005_-321775458	<yes>I hope to try all the wonderful food you can cook here on <IslandName>.
Generic/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_006_-2082366573	Lovely to meet you, <petName>.þ
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_000_-342005762	<wave>Oh, hello.
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_001_-373904764	My name is <myName>.
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_002_-1180763413	<NPCName> told me about you.
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_003_-1987926813	He's my big brother.
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_004_1227908502	<NPCName> told me that your name is <PlayerName>.
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_005_-172808981	<no>I asked him if you liked bugs and stuff, but he said he didn’t know.þ
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_006_-1953011906	So anyway, do you like bugs?
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_007_-222941299	<glee>I really, really love bugs.
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_008_-1297054754	<NPCName> told me to come visit him here on <IslandName> because there are lots of bugs.
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_009_-1552206067	And guess what?
Generic/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_010_-1451369792	<pumped>He was right!
Generic/14 NPC_Ghost_Intro_000_1657316191	Ah! Hey there!
Generic/14 NPC_Ghost_Intro_001_312701957	I'm <myName>. I moved into the new house here.
Generic/14 NPC_Ghost_Intro_002_818710158	You're <PlayerName>, right?
Generic/14 NPC_Ghost_Intro_003_1832297057	I heard that you're the one thats been working hard to get this town set up?
Generic/14 NPC_Ghost_Intro_004_-1600818971	Well, thanks for that, <PlayerName>! <glee>

Generic/15 NPC_Villager_Intro_003_1832297057	I heard that you're the one thats been working hard to get this town set up?
Generic/15 NPC_Villager_Intro_004_-1600818971	Well, thanks for that, <PlayerName>! <glee>
Generic/6 NPC_Fletch_Intro_000_1850724858	So, <PlayerName> . We made it.
Generic/6 NPC_Fletch_Intro_001_-1908716033	Let's find a place we can start building!
Generic/8 NPC_Sally_Details_Intro_000_-611028823	Oh. My. Goodness.
Generic/8 NPC_Sally_Details_Intro_001_572996291	The things I could do with that hair? 
Generic/8 NPC_Sally_Details_Intro_002_-1957454464	Magic. <pumped>
Generic/8 NPC_Sally_Details_Intro_003_-980894926	Oh, sorry. I'm <myName>.
Generic/8 NPC_Sally_Details_Intro_004_740202000	If you're getting tired of that hairstyle, or the colour?
Generic/8 NPC_Sally_Details_Intro_005_-1185511548	I can try my best to change it for you. <shy>
Generic/AcceptDog_Intro_000_-147787443	Oh, so you placed the <itemName>?
Generic/AcceptDog_Intro_001_-1989406283	What kind of dog would you like?
Generic/AcceptDog_Option_000_1332309979	A fancy boy!
Generic/AcceptDog_Option_001_-1822715797	A good boy!
Generic/AcceptDog_Option_002_1974638204	A little boy!
Generic/AcceptDog_Option_003_2097276319	A loyal boy!
Generic/AcceptDog_Response_000_000_1232454629	Great. Lets give them a name, okay?
Generic/AcceptDog_Response_001_000_1232454629	Great. Lets give them a name, okay?
Generic/AcceptDog_Response_002_000_1232454629	Great. Lets give them a name, okay?
Generic/AcceptDog_Response_003_000_1232454629	Great. Lets give them a name, okay?
Generic/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_000_-210546769	þExcellent.
Generic/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_001_1969418092	<proud>I will begin right away.
Generic/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_002_-1049060912	<yes>It will probably take all night, but I assure you, it will be ready by tomorrow.
Generic/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_003_2000279374	Now, if you do not mind, I have work to do.
Generic/AtWorkChat_Intro_000_1540723382	Oh, what did you want to chat about?
Generic/AtWorkChat_Response_002_000_-242599561	Oh, alright then.
Generic/Blueprint_Hand_Intro_000_604247592	I can't learn anything new from this...
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_000_2128753632	<yes><PlayerName>, I see you have been repairing the Tele-Towers around the island.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_001_1405810327	<thinking>To be honest, I did not think you had the know-how to even understand what they were intended for…
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_002_-34697312	<yes>Regardless, I have come up with an idea to build a <itemName> that we could place wherever we want.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_003_-491501579	<thinking>Now adding too many would most likely disrupt the Tele-Network.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_004_510287240	<yes>So I think we will only be able to build one.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_005_-1627549334	I have spoken to <NPCName> and she has agreed to add it to the available deeds.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeAccepted_Intro_000_2080560024	<shock>Oh, <PlayerName>!
Generic/BuildTownOfficeAccepted_Intro_001_-359233016	I wanted to let you know that <IslandName> has been cleared to build 3 additional buildings.þ
Generic/BuildTownOfficeAccepted_Intro_002_-248603407	<pumped>These buildings are additional houses!þ
Generic/BuildTownOfficeAccepted_Intro_003_-23336819	<thinking>I’ve been told we can use them for whatever purpose we want.þ
Generic/BuildTownOfficeAccepted_Intro_004_1212924666	<glee>I’ll let you decide whether the new house is storage, a display home or a place for a friend to stay when they come to visit.þ
Generic/BuildTownOfficeAccepted_Intro_005_797106669	<yes>We’re allowed to have three total here on <IslandName>.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeAccepted_Intro_006_-1388194236	So come and ask me about the deeds when you want to build one!
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_000_-1544073661	Oh, and thanks for placing the <itemName>. You're a good friend, <PlayerName>. <glee>
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_000_169551321	Great work! We'll have our town bustling in no time.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_000_-714852998	<glee>Oh, and thanks for placing the <itemName>.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_001_2098106579	You're a good friend, <PlayerName>.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_001_-734451789	Here is a deed for a Market Place. This will be a place for visitors to set up their home or shop while they stay here.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_002_-1787998775	It might be a good idea to visit their tents and say hello!
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_003_566251941	If you give them enough business, and maybe do a couple of odd jobs for them, they might move here permanently!
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_004_2002099736	Once the post office is built, we can have a look at some more deeds to place, okay?
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_005_-2069547865	I'm looking forward to seeing more people move here!
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_000_-1962561301	Oh, <PlayerName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_000_620876814	Hey <PlayerName> .
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_000_-747642734	Hey <PlayerName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_001_1088913912	<glee>I, like, have a gift for you.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_001_-1649744051	I've had an idea for something <IslandName> could really use!
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_001_282348627	Lets start building our town!
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_002_-1088941521	Take this <itemName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_002_-1686179400	We're going to need just the basic to begin with.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_002_96655091	It's my <itemName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_003_-1147237375	<proud>I thought people could maybe put things they don't want in here.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_003_5671077	Are you ready?
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_003_-962141914	<shy>I've been adding information to it, like, my whole life.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_004_-1475224751	<thinking>You could probably use it to get some infomation on any plants you are growing.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_004_-74488930	<yes>I will clear it out on Thursdays.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_005_-1364099555	<yes>Oh, don't worry about me, I think you'll, like, get more use out of it to be honest.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_005_39466413	<shocked>What am I doing with the stuff?
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_006_-199127324	<shy>I'm going to recycle it...
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_006_-568848218	<haha>Anyway, I've got all the info up here!
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_007_1099993286	<glee>Anyway, if you could place it down somewhere, that would be great.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_008_-786666232	<yes>Be sure to check it every so often.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_009_1854160006	<yes>Anything you find in it is up for grabs, so feel free to take it!
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Option_000_-1606942539	I'm ready!
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Option_001_-69965705	Not yet.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_000_000_808411356	Okay! I'm going to get you to place some land deeds.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_000_001_-770532669	These deeds will show people where they can build their houses or businesses.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_000_002_-1762158164	Use this Axe to clear the land where you want to place the deed.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_000_003_-970673915	Land deeds can only be placed on clear and levelled land.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_000_004_1815570903	Come back and talk to me once you have placed the deed.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_001_000_1483587720	Not a problem! I'll let you have a look around for now.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_001_001_1950401688	Have a look around, and then come back when you're ready.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Response_001_002_-1936828151	Just be sure it's before night time! We don't want to be setting up in the dark.
Generic/Completed_Intro_000_1235116400	Well done <PlayerName>.
Generic/Completed_Intro_000_-1962561300	Oh, <PlayerName>!
Generic/Completed_Intro_001_-1733357639	<IslandName> is growing very nicely.
Generic/Completed_Intro_001_233960376	You have acquired 10 <itemName>.
Generic/Completed_Intro_002_1679263794	With our current population, <SouthCity> has offically recognised <IslandName> as a settlement.
Generic/Completed_Intro_002_-750710210	<no>I did not think this was possible.
Generic/Completed_Intro_003_1263283209	<yes>I am impressed.þ
Generic/Completed_Intro_003_-1273784858	That means we can upgrade the base tent into a real Town Hall.
Generic/Completed_Intro_004_1158336108	<proud>I'll tell you what, I'll cover the costs myself.
Generic/Completed_Intro_004_1528062265	Now, if you would allow me to study the 10 <itemName>.þ
Generic/Completed_Intro_005_-1090788033	If I could ask you to gather items required for the Town Hall.
Generic/Completed_Intro_005_1204797659	<thinking>….þ
Generic/Completed_Intro_006_729021287	<yes>I've put a Deposit Box out the front of the Base Tent.
Generic/Completed_Intro_006_741868321	<thinking>Hmmm…
Generic/Completed_Intro_007_-1867146238	<shocked>Yes!þ
Generic/Completed_Intro_007_-690945564	<shy>I'll tell you what, you've really changed my life for the better, <PlayerName>.
Generic/Completed_Intro_008_1135824253	<glee>I believe there is a way to process this into a usable material.þ
Generic/Completed_Intro_008_-1240599561	<yes>Infact, everyone here on <IslandName> owes it all to you!
Generic/Completed_Intro_009_1026636179	<yes>It's not much, but we wanted to get you a gift.
Generic/Completed_Intro_009_-1119247744	Studying this <itemName> has given me an idea for a new invention.
Generic/Completed_Intro_010_-117808786	<yes>Think of it as a symbol of gratitude from everyone here on <IslandName>.
Generic/Completed_Intro_010_-1184179880	Please, <PlayerName>, come talk to me if you want me to craft you something new!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_-1102451121	Ah, goodmorning <PlayerName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_-1131307374	Oh, you've found something to eat!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_-1832589873	So, this is where you decided to build, huh?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_-1833718625	Oh! So you bought the <itemName>! þ
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_-325453601	So, we're all set for visitors, huh? 
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_-510183520	You found a good place for your tent?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_879125259	<glee>Well done, <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_947322209	Well done, <PlayerName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_-1111562245	<glee>It’s absolutely perfect! Our new home here on <IslandName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_1204838453	Did you happen to see that <NPCName> has set up his tent at the Visitor's Site?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_-1322458036	<glee>I knew I could count on you to find everything we need!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_244996661	Well done <PlayerName>! 
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_296124578	<yes>Eating food will help keep your energy up!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_761101816	<yes>You have proven yourself invaluable once again!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_-824658144	<shy>I know it's not much, but I hope you like your new home!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_947322209	Well done, <PlayerName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_-1111875609	<pumped>We’ve only been here for a little while, but you’ve achieved so much already!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_-1427252874	Don't you think having <NPCName> here is great?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_1484329717	Here is the recipe for a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_1623889164	<shocked>You're really starting to carry a lot of stuff around!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_1928888426	Thank you so much for setting up the Base Tent.<yes>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_-2133401325	<yes>I told him all about you and how you’ve helped us get started here.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_-717488053	I'll tell you what, you've got the "spark", <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_743565677	Here is a recipe for a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_1072240551	Now why don't you try crafting the <itemName> at the crafting table in the base tent?þ
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_1079006500	<yes>You see, most people back in <SouthCity> are scared of leaving.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_1725518075	<yes>I'll tell you what, I'll teach you how to craft a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_-1882551228	Oh, and guess what? I actually have a <itemName> for you too! <haha>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_1942131548	<haha>He sounded impressed!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_605077022	<thinking>If only we could  convince <NPCName> to move here permanently...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_760758615	<yes>You remind me of my father. He was born right here on <IslandName>, you know?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_-962788963	I found these stones earlier so you can use these to craft your <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_-1126047002	<thinking>Hmmmm...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_-1376995402	<thinking>There is something about that place that pulls the "spark" out of people...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_1532535249	<shy>You'll have to find some wood yourself though.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_-2073826596	John trades all sorts of things back to <SouthCity>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_-2123380490	<yes>Once you've crafted the <itemName>, pop it on the ground outside somewhere.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_-2127518162	<yes>You're going to need a recipe for Nails too.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_-508311659	<shy>I know it's not much but it will be a place you can call home!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_-852805276	<proud>He was a true blue Adventurer through and through.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_-1416430934	<no>But I'll tell you what, we certainly aren't the first to leave!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_-1497776502	I reckon nearly anything you can find on this island will be valuable to him.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_1509954919	Then, just place the ore inside of it.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_-1914532031	Feel free to use the crafting table in the Base Tent to craft a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_2000421095	<proud>I'll tell you what, <IslandName> is well on it's way to being a great settlement again!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_658971535	Now, there is plenty of room to spread out here on <IslandName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_-751055028	<haha>Well, let's worry about getting the materials needed for a permanent building first!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_995654552	He loved doing new things and keeping track of all his milestones in his <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_-1170521852	<sigh>I wanted to come here and try and meet those milestones myself.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_1572877707	Take your time, <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_1653916789	<yes>With a furnace and a table saw we can start thinking about building more permanent structures.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_1845923844	Have you ever heard of the traveling trader, <NPCName>?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_326360648	So please take your time to place your <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_-382650368	He’ll buy fruit, fish, bugs and even rocks! <yes>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_-501991591	It will take a little while to do its thing, so feel free to do some other activities while it's melting.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_567658910	The <itemName> is a great first step!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_-1195301293	<yes>You’ll probably be visiting the Base Tent a fair bit.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_1206714432	Bring me the Tin Bar when you're ready, okay?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_1592949634	<NPCName> also sells a lot of useful tools.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_17667974	For now, you can have a break.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_1830237417	<no>But I’m getting a bit long in the tooth, <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_598148531	When you are done, come and have a chat with me.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_622314739	I'll tell you what, we should try and get <NPCName> to set up a real shop here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_-1216962832	<thinking>So keep that in mind while you are looking for a spot to claim as your own.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_-1261787410	<glee>I have a gift for you!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_-1323429580	<shy>Please, I want you to take his <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_-1481314828	He’s got mining equipment, logging tools and even some fishing equipment.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_1924288172	<yes>Come back and talk to me when you are ready.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_009_121286966	<yes>Please keep good care of it.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_009_-1842020870	I’ll be inside the Base Tent getting things ready. 
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_009_805881827	<thinking>Although, probably can't sell you a lot of tools until you have all your <Licences> in order.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_010_1790072338	You know about <Licences>, right?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_010_1859816844	Come and speak to me once you’ve placed your <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_010_-1916541437	This is your adventure now.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_000_-1670693026	Let's do it!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_000_-1910102940	No I don’t.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_000_2051917353	No I haven't.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_001_-1585392778	How do we do that?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_001_543507182	Of course I have!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_001_618453623	Yes I do.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_000_-1332368638	That's the spirit, <PlayerName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_000_-1685813350	<yes>I'll tell you what, he’s a bloody legend!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_000_2033315250	<Licences> are an old <SouthCity> idea!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_001_-1271428549	<yes>I reckon if we spend a bit of money at his tent, he'll see it's worth while...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_001_-479982426	I’ll tell you what, you didn’t need a <Licence> for anything back when I was growing up!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_001_770855502	Rumour is he traded a paperclip for a steam boat once!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_002_-389451587	<no>But these days, you need a <Licence> for everything.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_002_536793497	<proud>Trading is in his very blood!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_002_-884505517	<yes>Oh, and we should show him how friendly people are around here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_003_1983539231	<NPCName> got in contact with me before we left <SouthCity>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_003_785886203	Luckily I’m actually an accredited <Licence> Giver! <proud>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_003_-975243381	Why don't you ask <NPCName> if he has anything he needs done?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_004_-1035654162	<pumped>He's interested in visiting with his shop here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_004_2050016583	<haha>If we can prove to him that <IslandName> is a great place to move, I'm sure he'll ask to live here for good!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_004_-641509215	If you want to apply for a <Licence> come and talk to me. <yes>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_005_-1788102040	<no>I'll tell you what, we can't miss an opportunity like this!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_005_2121549841	You’ll have to spend some <PermitPoints> to get them, but if you keep doing milestones you’ll make enough in no time.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_006_1001518262	As you get better at doing certain tasks, new <Licence> levels will open up too.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_006_-1482866176	<yes>I reckon we get this <itemName> ready for him.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_007_-1708111722	<yes>That way we'll have a place ready for any visitors who come to <IslandName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_007_-2116564043	Now, let’s see if there is a <Licence> you can apply for right now...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_008_1532368872	I’ll let you decide where the best place for this <itemName> is.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_009_34737173	<haha>Just be sure it's closeby!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_010_-260693956	<glee>We want visitors to feel like part of the <IslandName> community while they are here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_011_-1684863497	Who knows, maybe we can convince him to set up a permanent shop here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_012_341734295	<yes>Be sure to talk to me once you have placed the <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_000_1304920068	<haha>Who hasn't!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_000_167561329	That's great!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_000_287986152	<thinking>Hmmmm....

Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_003_1248788345	<PlayerName>! Can you hear me?
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_004_-1555037958	<yes>I’m so glad you’re okay!
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_005_-1699377034	It looks like you fainted out there!þ
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_006_-175534638	<yes>Please be careful out there and always keep an eye on your health and energy.
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_007_-1133272316	<no>If the world starts losing colour you know you’ve worked too hard.
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_008_-802458481	<yes>Please make sure you eat something to keep your energy up.
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_009_-999291396	<shy>When you didn’t return after a while, I had to call for a search party from <SouthCity> to come and find you.
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_010_-488521108	<worried>Those guys delivered you here, but it looks like they went through your pockets and took a fair cut of your <Dinks>.
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_011_1251432533	Maybe they thought you wouldn't notice?
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_012_1383025854	<thinking>It looks like some of your tools have taken a bit of damage too…
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_013_-765582249	Please be careful out there, <PlayerName>.
Generic/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_014_1025826030	<haha>I’ll tell you what, I’m glad you’re okay, but I don’t really want to have to go through that again!
Generic/FlyOverIntroConvo_Intro_000_335220139	We are now flying over <IslandName> and we’ll be landing shortly.þ
Generic/FlyOverIntroConvo_Intro_001_414523492	All passengers, please prepare to leave the Airship.

Generic/GivenSmeltingIngredient_Intro_000_1149130067	Thank you, <PlayerName>.
Generic/GivenSmeltingIngredient_Intro_001_1996132898	Take these <BulletinBoardReward>. I just like smelting them and I don't really need them.
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_-1263346078	Oh <PlayerName>!
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_-1962561300	Oh, <PlayerName>!
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_-214889772	<PlayerName>, I've been contacted by some of the people back in <SouthCity>.
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_620639688	<yes><IslandName> is really starting to grow…
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_-876243354	Ah, <PlayerName>.þ
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_1607847307	<thinking>I’ll tell you what, it might be a good idea to build a Band Stand.
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_2017910248	The towns ecconomy is growing very nicely.
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_-426756509	Our town is really growing!
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_-541339194	<no>I've been notified that we will need 5 permanent residents before <IslandName> is recognised as an official settlement.
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_-903664867	Am I correct in assuming that you have discovered the incredibly rare <itemName>.
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_-161680636	Now, there is no hurry, but maybe that should be our next goal?
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_1664411005	I think it might be a good time for us to think about maybe building a bank.
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_-1923800023	<thinking>I have seen this ore referenced often in the data I have been extracting from the shiny discs.
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_-83166712	Someone has let me know they are interesting in living here.
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_-995918088	<haha>No, we’re not having any musical guests any time soon.
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_-1168595770	<haha>I'll tell you what, any visitors that see how nice <IslandName> is will want to stay anyway!
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_1802048118	There is a new deed for a home avaliable. <yes>
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_1918653559	Please speak to me if you are interested in applying for a bank deed! <yes>
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_-2045966317	<PlayerName>, if <IslandName> had a Band Stand, we could use it as a place to host events.
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_-446388637	<thinking>However, I must admit, I had assumed that it was a myth...
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_-1349217981	Once <SouthCity> recognises <IslandName> as an official settlement, we can build a Town Hall!
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_1757828244	Once their home is build I'm sure they will move in! <glee>
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_1930163978	We could host parties, gatherings, celebrations…
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_608156424	If you could bring me 10 <itemName>, I believe I may have a way to process it into a very useful material.
Generic/Intro_Intro_005_1933124304	<glee>I'm sure we'll reach our goal soon!
Generic/Intro_Intro_005_518937087	Please come back and speak to me once you have collected the <itemName>.
Generic/Intro_Intro_005_710745444	<glee>It would be a place where everyone on <IslandName> could gather and just hang out.
Generic/Intro_Intro_006_1422204396	I’ve already applied for the <itemName>.
Generic/Intro_Intro_007_257424104	<yes>So, come and speak to me if you think we are ready to build it.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_-1569145569	<shy>That journal means a lot to me.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_1629639531	<PlayerName>! I received a letter earlier today from someone named <NPCName>. Unusual name, if you ask me.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_198331473	I’m very impressed with the work you’ve done here today, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_-2000246468	Wow!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_-242915526	<shy>I’ve got another job for you, <PlayerName>.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_722888991	As you know, we’ve been tasked with starting a new settlement on this island.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_852993994	Oh, <PlayerName>. I almost forgot!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_-970336406	I’ve got another job for you! You up for it?þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_1116324334	I noticed <NPCName> is selling a <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_-1212718341	 You up for it?
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_-1311643710	<glee>Smell that fresh air!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_-1366044649	<proud>I think there is a great future for us all here at <IslandName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_-420770067	<shy>But I think my Dad would be glad someone like you is looking after it.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_442058723	I know you’ve just arrived but I’m going to need your help right away!þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_459401005	Now I’ve heard of this fella. He’s a travelling trader. More than that, he’s a bloody legend.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_1270644192	I'll tell you what, it feels good to finally be back on <IslandName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_-1594068275	<pumped>But, I have a challenge for you, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_-1888342990	Rumour is he traded a paperclip for a boat once!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_-293567288	The first thing we need to do is set up a base camp.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_733784608	That’s a tool I think will be very handy, indeed!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_747685788	<shy>Here is a gift for helping me out so much.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_-2007296247	It's a <itemName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_-2096800245	Trading is in his very blood!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_-275257405	Now, <PlayerName>, I’m going to need your help getting settled, okay?þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_30671916	I think we should try and make enough money to buy a <itemName> from <NPCName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_-635629695	<pumped>I want you to try and beat my Father’s milestones.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_697193655	Take this <itemName>. This will be our base of operations as it were. We will be building the settlement out from there.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_-1781835215	Here is my half of the Dinks. The rest is up to you! 
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_-325273725	Well, he’s heard about all the hard work we’re doing putting this town together, and he reckons he wants to bring his little travelling store right here.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_-496340670	I think you should take the rest of the day off.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_-706726307	Please take your time to look around the island before deciding where to start our new settlement.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_727618014	<no>Some of these milestones are going to take a long time to complete, but there is no hurry.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_752075203	<yes>I’ll give you this <itemName>. Take your time and find a good place for it. It’ll be like our town hub!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_-2054956679	Once you have found a suitable place,  you will need to clear out the land to place the <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_-618367852	Maybe you could go catch some of the bugs around here?
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_708294208	Take this map as well. If you have any questions, please just ask me.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_-710195983	Opportunity is knocking, so let’s answer that door with a smile. Let's clear out some more space somewhere for this <itemName>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_854179379	<thinking>I’m also going to add daily tasks to the journal. These will be smaller milestones that should be easy to complete in just one day.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_123108970	<proud>Now for the good part.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_-1257970892	I’ll give you some tools that I’ve brought with me. These should be enough to clear some space to set up the <itemName>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_-1639147781	Or maybe you could cook some of that fruit you found?
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_791496002	That way, there will be a place for anyone visiting our island to stay.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_-99050250	<shy>I haven’t been back to <IslandName> for a very long time, but I think I can still be helpful.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_1114787428	<glee>For every milestone you surpass, you’ll be rewarded with <PermitPoints>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_1851400276	<PlayerName>, take this <itemName> and place it somewhere you think would be a good place visitors can stay.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_-2100263442	<yes>I’ll be waiting by this dock until you set up the <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_-549091366	I will wait here at the dock, but I will meet you at the <itemName> once you’ve got it set up. If you have any further questions please come and see me.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_008_-1881163559	<yes>I'll tell you what, you're going to want a lot of <PermitPoints> eventually.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_008_-586656376	I’m so glad you’ve made it here safe and I’m very excited to be working with you!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_008_789647336	<yes>So if you get lost, just check your map to find the dock again.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_009_1349171058	<no>But we can talk more about that tomorrow.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_009_-291966791	Good luck, <PlayerName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_010_1498227890	<yes>For now, check out the journal.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_011_1278655722	<shocked>I think you’ll find that you’ve actually completed some of the milestones inside.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_012_-1088063672	So be sure to claim them. <glee>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_013_1664806021	<yes>Now, are you hungry? I am.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_014_-1972654220	<haha>I think it's just about lunch time.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_015_-880849660	<glee>I’ve seen fruit growing around this island and that sounds tasty!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_016_53939396	<yes>You go and find us some fruit and when you get back I will show you how to craft a <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_000_1132139550	I'll figure out something to do...
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_000_-1606942539	I'm ready!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_001_-478799519	I'm ready for bed!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_001_624177361	I want to apply for a licence.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_001_-69965705	Not yet.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_002_-69965705	Not yet.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_000_-1843857184	I'll tell you what, I think camping is fun!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_000_-419569558	If we are going to build anything around here we’re going to need materials.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_000_-782283446	<haha>I’m sure you will! 
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_001_-1321341458	I reckon we need to wood and Tin. þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_001_-1806245968	Oh and before I forget, take this <itemName> too.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_001_1968507738	<yes>But if we’re going convince people to stay here on <IslandName> we’ve gotta start building more permanent structures.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_002_1331364812	When you get tired, pop that on the ground and have a lay down.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_002_1742165851	Now, wood? That’s easy. You chop down a tree and then you’ve got some wood.þ <yes>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_002_986515132	<thinking>I’ve noticed there is a lot of <itemName> on this island. I’ve seen it popping out of rocks all over the place.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_003_1994797160	But Tin? That’s a bit trickier. I’ve seen it around the island poking out of rocks here and there. It’s a dark ore. You’ll know it if you see it.<yes>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_003_-453960907	<haha>I'll tell you what, a good nights rest will do us both good!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_003_-651896406	<proud>I know a way we can melt down <itemName> into stuff great for building.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_004_-1175240756	Now, we’re going to need to smelt it down into bars before we can use the Tin Ore for building things. <thinking>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_004_-1744869158	Now, I'll need you to bring me some items.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_004_-262901937	Thanks for your help today, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_005_-473947908	Go give the island a bit of a looky-loo for <questRequiredItems>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_005_-663368128	We'll need <questRequiredItems>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_005_-746266014	I can't believe we're on <IslandName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_006_1509189673	<glee>I couldn't have done any of this without you!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_006_1906879721	Bring them back here and I'll show you how we can turn Tin Ore into bars. <glee>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_006_-540063108	Keep in mind, you will need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect ore and rocks.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_007_-1381187682	<proud>Once you’ve gathered everything we need, come and see me!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_000_-1196759346	Let's have a look then.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_000_-1957840966	<haha>I'm tired too!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_000_675313766	Righto then.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_001_1008245657	Here, take this <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_001_-1345979539	Come see me soon, okay?
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_002_-1535466377	If you are tired, pop that on the ground and have a lay down.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_003_-453960907	<haha>I'll tell you what, a good nights rest will do us both good!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_004_-262901937	Thanks for your help today, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_005_-746266014	I can't believe we're on <IslandName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_006_1509189673	<glee>I couldn't have done any of this without you!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_002_000_-154524916	<yes>Righto.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_002_001_-140313311	You've been helping out a lot, so take your time, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_002_002_1921055682	<glee>Just come back and see me when you're ready.
Generic/MoveInRequest_Intro_000_-1446619794	Hey, <PlayerName>.
Generic/MoveInRequest_Intro_001_299494211	I've decided I really like it here. 
Generic/MoveInRequest_Intro_002_1613060812	So, I spoke to Fletch, and I've applied for a deed so I can set up a permanent store here in town.
Generic/MoveInRequest_Intro_003_353700454	I hope I can move in soon!
Generic/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_000_1227863250	There are so many amazing creatures and plants on this island! <pumped>þ
Generic/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_001_-656196659	I think it might be worth documenting them all, correct? <yes>þ
Generic/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_002_-847696636	What if we built a museum here?þ
Generic/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_003_855745866	Somewhere where we could gather all of the amazing things here for everyone to see?þ <glee>
Generic/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_004_1539888037	I’ll talk to <NPCName> about applying for a <itemName>.þ
Generic/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_005_-333309261	This is so exicting! <glee>
Generic/NoItemGiven_Intro_000_-741719496	Oh, you don't have <requestItem> at all.
Generic/NoItemGiven_Intro_001_1718309357	Let me know if you find <requestItem>.
Generic/NoPhotoGiven_Intro_000_1658853761	Oh, you don't have the photo? Thats ok!
Generic/PlaceKennelRequest_Intro_000_1419178827	Hey <PlayerName>. Want a pet dog?
Generic/PlaceKennelRequest_Intro_001_124223727	<yes>If you do place this <itemName> somewhere and come and speak to me.
Generic/RequestItem_Incorrect_1_Intro_000_1413618201	Oh...
Generic/RequestItem_Incorrect_1_Intro_001_502869155	I actually wanted <requestItem>.
Generic/RequestItem_Incorrect_1_Intro_002_773429586	I'll give this back.
Generic/SellItemByWeight_Intro_000_-1685463684	Ah, I see you've got a nice <sellByWeightName> there.
Generic/SellItemByWeight_Intro_001_812004310	Looks like it weighs around <getItemWeight>!
Generic/SellItemByWeight_Intro_002_23656262	How does <getItemByWeightPrice> sound for it?
Generic/SellItemByWeight_Option_000_-1273337393	Yes
Generic/SellItemByWeight_Option_001_1496915101	No
Generic/SellItemByWeight_Response_000_000_1562504969	Thank you very much!
Generic/SellItemByWeight_Response_001_000_375359677	No worries, mate.
Generic/ShipmentRequestComplete_Intro_000_531279436	Wow! You really got the shipment ready for me?
Generic/ShipmentRequestComplete_Option_000_-1362156820	Sure did.
Generic/ShipmentRequestComplete_Option_001_688230645	Nah.
Generic/ShipmentRequestComplete_Response_001_000_-1994636920	Oh, righto, <PlayerName>...
Generic/SmeltingRequestCompleteConvo_Intro_000_1141631307	You brought me <requestItem> ?
Generic/SmeltingRequestCompleteConvo_Option_000_-347156278	Here you go!
Generic/SmeltingRequestCompleteConvo_Option_001_-1145092696	Not yet, sorry.
Generic/SmeltingRequestCompleteConvo_Response_000_000_262009994	Looking forward to smelting these puppies down!
Generic/SmeltingRequestCompleteConvo_Response_001_000_661758755	Ah... I see.
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_000_1556973846	Looks like we've landed!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_001_-214624691	<glee>þI'll tell you what, I’m so glad you’ve decided to accompany me on this adventure, <PlayerName>.
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_002_804688963	<worried>þI was starting to think no one in <SouthCity> was brave enough to join me!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_003_-830957595	<haha>When you were the first and only person to respond to my ad, I knew you were the right person for the job!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_004_-1762538434	<no>Oh dear, look at old <myName> waffle on...
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_005_-173961940	Let's get cracking, <PlayerName>!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_006_1341706698	I'll see you outside, okay?
Generic/StopFollowing 1_Intro_000_-94525041	What do you do for fun around here aanyway, <PlayerName>?
Generic/StopFollowing 1_Option_000_1116896312	This was fun...
Generic/StopFollowing 1_Option_001_-794442186	Let's keep going.
Generic/StopFollowing 1_Response_000_000_1274201167	Alright, it was nice hanging with you.
Generic/StopFollowing 1_Response_001_000_1587895751	Lead the way!

Generic/StopFollowing 3_Response_000_000_1274201167	Alright, it was nice hanging with you.

Generic/StopFollowing 4_Response_000_000_-77204772	Alright, it was nice hanging with you. <wave>

Generic/StopFollowing_Response_001_000_-1152895088	Let's go!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_-1159492583	<PlayerName>! How is the search going?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_-1375584020	We've done some good work today, <PlayerName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_-182654077	<PlayerName>! Have you found a place for the <itemName>?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_189174244	Ah, <PlayerName> what do you think of the <itemName>?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_30233409	<PlayerName>. How goes the tucker hunting?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_327711929	Hi there, <PlayerName>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_-485848697	Ah, <PlayerName>. Hows it going, mate? Do you have any questions?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_-530129884	How goes the money making, <PlayerName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_1452965081	Have you earned enough to buy that <itemName> we need?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_-1752492525	Have you managed to get a <itemName>?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_-2122772598	Have you found all those items we need?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_2142611740	Take the rest of the day off! 
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_-66238762	I got it all set up fairly quickly, right! <haha>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_002_1230675462	How’d you go setting up yours?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_002_419142363	<yes>We've got more work to do tomorrow!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_114593604	How do I place the tent?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_-1278867010	Tell me about the Island.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_168896058	Crafting a fire?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_-1731408098	Where can I find fruit?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_-203490839	What do I need again?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_-2049966453	How do I place the deed?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_624177361	I want to apply for a licence.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_-174410593	Where can I get a campfire?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_-2089820252	How do I craft a Furnace?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_-235570607	Where do you think we should set up camp?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_-565877925	How do I make money?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_-57732441	I haven't set up yet.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_655795600	I'm still looking.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_-69965705	Not yet.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_-863988609	Cooking at a fire?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_-1082745214	How do I make a Tin Bar?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_114593604	How do I place the tent?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_268007027	How do I get permit points?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_624177361	I want to apply for a licence.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_728651848	Bug hunting?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_-1135114799	I'm on it.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_1687369081	Still a bit to go.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_-1916902512	See ya!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_655795600	I'm still looking.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_-932794628	Sleeping?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_004_787199502	I'm on it!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_1335997775	Just select the <itemName> from your toolbelt. Just like you did with the tents.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_-1396503271	<thinking>You see, I was actually born here on <IslandName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_1701000100	I did see some fruit trees growing inland a bit on our ride over <IslandName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_1721143740	Feel free to use the <itemName> in the Base Tent whenever you want.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_-1800465161	Okay, here you go.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_2042313858	It's actually the same way you set up the Base Tent!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_886112009	We need <questRequiredItems>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_900384788	Alright then...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_-1676517815	I'll tell you what, I'm sure you'll learn how to craft lots of useful things here on <IslandName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_255062531	First select the <itemName> in your toolbelt so it’s in your hand.þ
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_-380499795	I’ve seen <itemName> here and there on the island. It's a dark ore poking out of rocks.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_587022324	Oh and make sure that the ground is nice and flat or you won't be able to place it.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_957029262	It usually grows on smaller trees and shrubs.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_-995013417	<no>Back before we moved to  <SouthCity>...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_-1381986955	<thinking>Hmmm...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_-2011304637	Just try shaking any tree you you can!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_-653394566	Your going to need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect ore.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_863666529	Once you use the <itemName> you’re going to have to decide where to place it.<yes>þ
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003_1067376337	If I remember correctly there are different fruits all over the island.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003_126305789	Oh, right. Let me tell you what I remember about <IslandName>...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003_-673058362	You’re going to need enough space for the <itemName> to be set up. The only other thing to keep in mind is that the ground needs to be flat and even. <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004_-1207797314	Come back and speak to me once you've got your <itemName> all set up.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004_-1864176945	If I remember correctly, up north you'll find a tropical climate.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004_-445557191	Good luck mate, looking forward to it! <glee>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_005_410910636	<thinking>To the south it can get a bit chilly, but I recall my Dad warned me about the wildlife down there…
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_006_-1343807361	To the east and west of the island are flat open plains. The ground is nice and flat, so it would be easy to build there.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_007_155593913	The coasts are a great place for fishing year-round. So if you like throwing a line, it might be worth setting up the <itemName> near the beach.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_008_1555359891	<haha>The centre of the island is a desert. It’s hot and dry there, and it’s full of bugs!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_009_-1700859568	<yes>But no matter where you decide we should build, being close to water is always a good idea. 
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_010_873813037	So if you want to set up inland anywhere, try and do it close to a river.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_011_1237308434	<haha>I feel like that’s a lot to take in. Sorry about that, <PlayerName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_1102091948	You're going to need to craft a <itemName> at the crafting table in the Base Tent.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_-1207797314	Come back and speak to me once you've got your <itemName> all set up.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_1892769095	Once you've got your <itemName> going, just put the item you want to cook into your hands.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_2127338726	<NPCName> will buy pretty much anything from you.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_-319725922	That's okay!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_-399734976	You can craft the <itemName> at the Crafting Table in the Base Tent.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_465116519	It’s been a long time since I was here last! I was a little girl back then, so I’ll let you figure out how long ago that was! <shy>

Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_002_1710430896	<no>Now, you don't have to buy the <itemName> right away.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_002_2006413791	<thinking>You'll want to eat a lot of food to keep your energy up!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_003_1672797068	The terrain there is flat and won't take too much effort to build on. Plus the climate should be good for farming most of the year. <yes>

Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001_1875809703	<yes>You'll also get a big lump of points by beating one of my Dad's milestones.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001_2030870961	Then, all you have to do then is hold the <itemName> in your hands and pop it in!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001_541790952	First select the <itemName> in your toolbelt so it’s in your hand.

Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002_924229908	Once you use the <itemName> you’re going to have to decide where to place it.<yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_003_1152030046	If you just go about your day doing your activites, I'm sure you'll get rewarded eventually!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_003_-673058362	You’re going to need enough space for the <itemName> to be set up. The only other thing to keep in mind is that the ground needs to be flat and even. <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_004_102047762	If you have any other questions, please come and ask me <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000_-1881099312	All right, mate. Keep your eyes peeled!

Npc4/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002_-807640739	<yes>I totally just felt the whole atmosphere around me change, y’know?
Npc4/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000_-147921477	<yes>I’m not a huge fan of fashion, but I am a big fan of making things.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001_-807880925	I like to think my clothes will live on longer than me, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002_-1888909649	<yes>Hopefully, they passed down generation to generation.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_022_Intro_003_1561353862	<glee>Imagine the stories they will tell!þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000_1442120643	I tried to make some clothes out of those <itemName> lying around <IslandName>.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001_-1175597864	<glee>In my head, it sounded awesome. All SPARKLY and SHARP!þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002_-1455879181	But I just couldn’t bring myself to finish the outfit, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_024_Intro_003_-1013787147	<thinking>It felt like… all the darkness within them was brighter than the light on the outside?
Npc4/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000_1096229343	I love how much you switch it up with your outfits, <PlayerName>.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001_-392307350	Some people just wear the same thing every day, y’know?þþþ
Npc4/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002_-1428692302	<haha>Sometimes I stare at them, trying to make them change.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_025_Intro_003_-1273001162	<no>I guess some people just aren't programmed that way.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000_975643662	<yes>I heard about the mines deep underground. þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001_814693872	<glee>Way down deep, and dark. þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002_1489584501	They still <Shift> so they’re constantly changing.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_026_Intro_003_105871714	<thinking>It’d be a really great place to hide something, y’know? 
Npc4/RandomConvo_026_Intro_004_-1269455549	<shy>If you needed one, I mean.
Npc4/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000_1861171485	<worried>I had the weirdest feeling yesterday. I’m so glad to see you’re still with us, <PlayerName>.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001_-1961363142	I’m pretty sure you’re going to be fine now, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000_-1783581595	<thinking>Y'know, I never really understood how everything went South.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001_58798784	<thinking>Maybe we just needed a reason to start all over again?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000_-1230828342	I’m so glad I’ve met you, <PlayerName>.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001_-1451000489	<shy>I feel like my life has totally turned around since meeting you, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002_-1034518899	<shy>I hope I’ve made you feel that way too.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000_-2013597009	Another great day where I get to talk to <PlayerName>.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001_-1852266481	I always enjoy our chats, <PlayerName>.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002_-2101971488	I enjoy chatting with all my good friends, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000_596685704	Do you think that maybe the universe had always intended for us to meet each other, <PlayerName>?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001_-1163027521	<thinking>Like there is some kind of background force pushing us together?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002_-58541515	I just feel like we’re very good friends, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_032_Intro_003_730203853	<haha>It’s kinda scary how good friends we’ve become, right?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000_889911477	Last night I had a weird dream that you were being controlled by someone, <PlayerName>.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001_-2070599362	<no>They had a window where they could look through it and make you move.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002_1982734452	<worried>It was really creepy, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000_-1069303596	Hey <PlayerName>, thank you for always being there to help me out when I need something done.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001_1813492299	<shy>I don’t think you know how much you have done for me..þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002_517382298	<shy>So I just wanted to say thank you, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000_-807247647	Sometimes it feels like we’re being watched, y’know?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001_1467023587	<thinking>Like there is someone listening to our conversation right now.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002_225862543	Do you ever get that feeling?þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000_1491416904	<pumped>When you feel that creative spark, you have to grab onto it tightly.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001_-1332700159	<no>Whatever you do... don’t let it escape.þ
Npc4/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002_-1075211917	<pumped>Hold onto that energy as long as you can and use it for something really special.þ

Npc5/TotalEqualsZeroTrapper_Intro_001_499494204	It seems these items aren't worth anything, but I can still take them off your hands if you don't want them?

Npc6/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001_861089093	It’s probably because you don’t talk as much as I do! You really know how to listen.þ
Npc6/RandomConvo_011_Option_000_802044850	I wanted...
Npc6/RandomConvo_011_Option_001_1468022373	Actually...

Npc6/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000_-524182525	<thinking>I know we’re a long way from <SouthCity> and I could probably just hand out all your <Licences> to you straight away...
Npc6/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001_-1760050709	<no>But let me tell you, <PlayerName>, you’re not going very far in life unless you work hard to get what you want!
Npc6/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000_1813398571	<yes>Let me tell you, even though I hate doing it, I’m bloody grouse at paperwork.
Npc6/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001_-1461214165	<shy>It’s just something I picked up quickly in <SouthCity>. þ
Npc6/RandomConvo_014_Intro_002_-1543720588	<haha>I guess it made me look like I was a local!þ
Npc6/RandomConvo_014_Intro_003_-1200273696	<yes>I’ll tell you what, if you wanted to do something in <SouthCity>, you needed a form to do it. þ
Npc6/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000_-504816331	<pumped>There’s so much for us still to discover here on <IslandName>!
Npc6/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001_577616948	<glee>I can’t I just can’t wait to hear all about it.
Npc6/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000_222501033	<no>You really should sleep more often <PlayerName>, it’s no good to run around with low energy!
Npc6/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001_-1513381765	I'll tell you what, why not take the rest of the day off?
Npc6/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000_-535209691	Thank you for looking after my Father’s <Journal>.þ

Npc6/TownCleanUp_Intro_001_-1942299683	<thinking>I can get someone to remove them for free, but we won't be able to save any of them.
Npc6/TownCleanUp_Intro_002_862922103	<yes>It will be all the items you can carry on the island!
Npc6/TownCleanUp_Intro_003_-1282606150	<yes>So please make sure you don't have any items you want to keep.

Npc6/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_002_384481156	Perhaps you can come back when your pockets are a bit heavier?

Npc7/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001_-2065225962	With all their own wildlife?
Npc7/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002_881494308	<glee>I heard there were HUNDREDS of different types of animals before everything went South..
Npc7/RandomConvo_032_Intro_003_1942494850	<thinking>Maybe they survived somewhere?þ
Npc7/RandomConvo_032_Intro_004_-1793904025	<sigh>I sure hope so...

Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_000_-1250786140	<pumped><NPCName> won’t let anybody NEAR his hair.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_001_2118359940	<no>I offered to trim his beard, but I ended up walking away with a bunch of tools I don’t need?þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_002_384901102	<boohoo>…they were really expensive.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_000_268961126	<NPCName>’s hair grows really slowly…þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_001_2049371061	Either that, or he trims it himself, I guess?þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_000_-999137015	<NPCName> comes to see me every now and again.
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_001_-1056062874	I guess he really likes the empty bit in the middle?þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_002_-547860246	<thinking>He’d have such long, full, beautiful locks if I didn’t cut his hair so often…þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_003_-1401334567	Each to their own, I guess.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_000_192740882	<no><NPCName> asked me to cut her doll’s hair once.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_001_-1021286863	<no>It looked just like her, but tiny!þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_002_424270026	<scared>That thing gave me the creeps.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_000_1147098473	<yes><NPCName> keeps asking if I have a Hair Cutting licence.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_001_1063867178	<pumped>And I keep telling her there is no such thing!þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_002_2007303129	<haha>But she seems adamant that there should be!þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_009_Intro_000_792515882	<thinking><NPCName> always asks to keep his hair clippings after a trim.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_009_Intro_001_-274117747	<yes>He said something about cataloguing every strand?þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_000_1429235000	<no><NpcName> never tips me when he comes in for a trim.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_001_-676996072	<no>I mean, I don’t ask for tips, anyway.þ
Npc8/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_002_82722473	<thinking>But he always makes sure to let me know he won’t be tipping…þ

Npc9/FullPhotoNoPhoto_Intro_002_-1562668056	I'm quite fond of it to be honest! <haha>
Npc9/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_000_2144235302	Hmmmm... The museum isn't really looking for this kind of thing.
Npc9/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_001_-209898310	Our collection include, fish, bugs and relics. If there are any other items you don't want, maybe consider selling them?
Npc9/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_002_2119706282	Thanks!
Npc9/NonLocalEmpty_Intro_000_-89390229	Oh, that's an empty frame.
